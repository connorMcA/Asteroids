Spaceships! Homework Project

Description:
A spaceship cannot seem to get away from these asteroids. Help it get away! (You can't)
You play as a spaceship that is haunted by the presence of 10 asteroids in the wonderful scene
of a poorly designed space background. You can shoot at them but it does nothing. 

List of user functionality:
Use either WASD or the arrow keys to control the ship
A and D or Left and Right turn the ship
W or Up makes the ship go forward
D or Down applies brakes to the ship, letting it stop very quickly

You can also left click to shoot a particle beam at the asteroids (but it doesn't do anything)

Reasoning behind design choices:
I chose to do two different shapes for the background because using only 1 made it feel too empty. It was going
	to update and move but it looked way too caotic so I left the code in but did not call it. 
As for the extra part, I added the functionality to shoot because that seemed relatively easy. I wasn't sure how
	to handle deleting asteroids so I did not have it do that.
